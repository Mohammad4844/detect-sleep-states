# Overview 
This is a comparative research study for the [Detecting Sleep States](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states) 
Kaggle Competition hosted by [The Child Mind Institute](https://childmind.org). The goal of this project is to compare the performance of various machine
learning models when detecting when exaclty a person wakes up 'wakeup', and when a person goes to sleep 'onset'.

This repository contains the following:
- A [paper](math319_project-1_detect-sleep-states_Mohammad.pdf) outlining the study and analysis
- The follwoing Jupyter Notebooks contain the code for this project, written in Python and using Pytorch, Hugging Face, and Pandas:
  - Original approach [notebook](detect_sleep_states_original.ipynb)
  - Revised approach [notebook](detect_sleep_states_revised.ipynb)

# Abstract

"This study addresses a Kaggle challenge to detect sleep transition events using machine learning. Different problem framing methods and models, including neural networks, XGBoost, and logistic regression, were explored, highlighting the importance of problem formulation and revealing neural networks' superior performance in this context."
